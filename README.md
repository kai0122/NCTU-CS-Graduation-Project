Our thesis is called: "Computer Vision-assisted virtual reality which reaches a wide range of multi-person simultaneous VR systems". We visually locate the virtual reality system, adding more possibilities to the interactive space of the virtual reality, enhancing fun and utility. By transmitting external camera lens signals to the host computer and using computer vision positioning system, we allow user to make multiple users interact in the same space, under the same system. We can get rid of the situation that only one person can experience the virtual world nowadays, making single space Multiple sets of VR devices being operated simultaneously to increase interactivity and entertainment.
